Pythons use their sharp, backward-curving teeth, four rows in the upper jaw, two in the lower, to grasp prey which is then killed by constriction; after an animal has been grasped to restrain it, the python quickly wraps a number of coils around it.[11][12] Death occurs primarily by cardiac arrest.[11][12] Even the larger species, such as the reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus), do not crush their prey to death.[13]

Larger specimens usually eat animals about the size of a domestic cat, but larger food items are known; some large Asian species have been known to take down adult deer, and the Central African rock python (Python sebae) has been known to eat antelope. The reticulated python is the only python species known to sometimes eat humans in its natural habitat in Sulawesi, Indonesia.[14] All prey is swallowed whole, and may take several days or even weeks to fully digest.
