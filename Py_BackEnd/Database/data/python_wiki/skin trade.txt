Trade in python skins is a lucrative business with the export market from Southeast Asia estimated at US$1 billion as of 2012.[20] Much of the trade is illegal, and python farming is very expensive.[21] Pythons are poached for their meat, mostly consumed locally as bushmeat, and their skin, which is sent to Europe and North America for manufacture of accessories like bags, belts and shoes.[22]

In Cameroon bushmeat markets, the Central African rock python (Python sebae) is sold for meat.[22] Hunting, killing and selling pythons is illegal in Cameroon under national wildlife law, but there is little to no enforcement.[22]
